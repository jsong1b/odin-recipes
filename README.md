# Odin Recipes

This is me going through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).
I already have experience programming but not much with web dev (just a little in AP CSP), which is why I decided to do the course.
This is a fun little project for HTML.

## What I'm Learning / Reviewing

- I think this project is basically a review for all the HTML we reviewed before in the course, so:
  - Creating HTML documents w/ proper boilerplate.
  - Formatting text properly (things like: paragraphs, bold, italics, etc.).
  - Creating lists.
  - Using links and images.
  - Basically reviewing what the HTML elements and tags we learned so far are.
- Additionally, just general review for things like:
  - Doing proper commit messages.
    - Wow, I really need to work on this looking at my commit history for past projects!
  - Just using Git and GitHub properly to manage the source code.

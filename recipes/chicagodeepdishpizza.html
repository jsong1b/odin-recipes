        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This deep-dish pizza recipe features a unique buttery cornmeal
            crust. Home cooks will find it more forgiving than its New York
            counterpart. No need to worry about having the hottest oven or too
            many toppings â€” just make sure your sauce is very thick and
            flavorful! I garnished mine with parsley and more Parmesan cheese.

                    <li>4 ounces sliced provolone cheese</li>
                    <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cubed</li>
                    <li>1 pound spicy Italian sausage, casings removed</li>
                    <li>
                        4 ounces shreded part-skim, low-moisture mozzarella
                        cheese

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Make the dough: Pour water into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted
                with a paddle attachment. Sprinkle in yeast and let dissolve,
                about 10 minutes. Add olive oil, melted butter, sugar, salt,
                cornmeal, and most of the flour, in that order. Knead, stopping
                occasionally to scrape down the sides and adding more flour as
                needed, until smooth and elastic.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Knead in extra
                flour if needed. Roll into a ball and transfer to a bowl greased
                with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil. Cover with a plate and let rise in
                a warm spot until doubled in volume, 1 to 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the dough is rising, simmer pizza sauce in a pot over low
                heat until very thick, 60 to 90 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                Poke dough to deflate and turn out onto your work surface. Press
                and stretch out dough into a round shape 3 to 4 inches larger
                than a 12-inch cast iron skillet. Brush the skillet with 1 1/2
                teaspoons olive oil. Place dough into the skillet; stretch and
                pull to evenly distribute it over the bottom and sides.
            </li>
            <li>
                Apply fillings and toppings in order as follows: Lay provolone
                cheese over the bottom of the crust. Scatter fresh mozzarella
                over provolone, then add Italian sausage and firm mozzarella.
                Ladle pizza sauce generously over top. Grate Parmesan cheese
                over pizza sauce, then fold the crust edges in towards the
                center to seal in the sides. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over
                crust and center of pizza.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the center of the preheated oven until crust sounds
                hollow when tapped and pizza is beautifully browned, about 35
                minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
            </li>
        </ol>

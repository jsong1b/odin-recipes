        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>

                Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and
                cook chicken pieces until golden brown. Once cooked, transfer
                the chicken to a plate and set aside.

            <li>Add onion and garlic to skillet and brown them.</li>
            <li>
                Pour soy sauce and vinegar with garlic powder, black pepper, and
                bay leaf onto skillet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Return the chicken to the pan and incrase heat to high, bringing
                the sauce to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and

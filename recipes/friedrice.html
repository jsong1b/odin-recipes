        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This fried rice recipe only takes 15 minutes to cook and tastes just
            like you get at your favorite Chinese restaurant. Leftover rice,
            plus a couple of eggs, baby carrots, peas, and soy sauce is all you
            need. Garnish with sliced green onions, if desired.
